## When starting a new project

 - [X] Customize this Readme.md to match your own project.
 - [ ] (optional) Configure [doctr](https://pypi.org/project/doctr/) and add the deploy key to the .travis.yml file for auto-generated documentation. Doctr is a python utility for automatically pushing a gh-pages branch through the travis build process. A repository requires some 1st time configuration using the `doctr` command line tool but once that is complete, the pushing process is fully automated. For instructions on configuring doctr: https://github.com/drdoctr/doctr#run-doctr-configure. The doctr command line tool can be found in the [PCDS conda environment](https://github.com/pcdshub/pcds-envs).
